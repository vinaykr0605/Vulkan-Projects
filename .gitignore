# Remove Cargo.lock from gitignore if this is an executable (standard practice)
# but the user had it ignored, so I'll keep it or move it to a commented section.
# Actually, for a demo project, it's often fine to keep it ignored if they want, 
# but usually we commit it for apps. I'll stick to what they had plus improvements.
